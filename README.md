# London-Housing-Project

# London Housing Market Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project was to determine which London boroughs have seen the greatest increase in housing prices on average over the last two decades.

## Methodology

### Data Sourcing and Cleaning
- The data was sourced from the London Datastore and focused on average house prices in London boroughs.
- Initial cleaning involved handling missing values, removing non-borough entries, and ensuring data integrity.

### Data Transformation
- The data was transformed to facilitate year-on-year comparison, focusing specifically on the years 1998 and 2018.

### Analysis
- Calculated percentage increases in average house prices for each borough between 1998 and 2018.
- Developed a function `create_price_ratio` to compute the ratio of average prices between 1998 and 2018 for each borough.

## Key Findings

### Boroughs with the Greatest Price Increase
- Hackney emerged as the borough with the most significant relative increase in house prices, followed by Waltham Forest, Southwark, Lewisham, and Westminster.
- These boroughs have seen average prices more than quadruple over the 20-year period, with Hackney leading the way.

## Insights
- The analysis highlights the rapidly changing landscape of the London housing market, with particular areas experiencing substantial growth in property values.
- The trends observed may reflect broader socio-economic shifts within the city, including regeneration and increased demand in specific boroughs.

## Recommendations for Stakeholders
- For potential homebuyers or real estate investors, the findings point towards boroughs that have historically shown strong price growth, which might indicate future investment potential.
- Policy makers and urban planners can use these insights to understand housing affordability challenges and target resources or interventions.
